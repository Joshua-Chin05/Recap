            Through this class I have developed many skills as well as leearning tons of new things. Within the different projects and sites we made,
            we learned about topics like job searching and salaries of jobs that we may enjoy in different states. Even though the primary aspect was about coding, the various 
            information we learned was also really cool and important for our futures. 
            Lastly, I learned a lot about the basics of code since I didn't know much before and I plan on trying to learn more of it in future years.
