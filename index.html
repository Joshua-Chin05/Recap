        <p> 
            I personally really enjoyed this class because I have had 0 background in coding prior to this class.
            This was a very cool opportunity to learn something new in regards to technology and it was super cool to see how websites are made.
            Personally I enjoyed the fact where it wasn't one of those create a thing through google sites or wiks, but we got to learn how to code our own.
            While mine certainly look as professional as using another site or other student's work, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn this. 
            Again as I have said before, I never knew how to code prior to this class, so I learned a lot. I learned all about HTML and how that affects websites,
            but also CSS or the back end of these websites that affect the design like where clicking a button my send you, or even just the fonts and text color.
            I signed up for this class in order to finish my VAPA credits in addition to wanting to dabble into a bit of coding.
